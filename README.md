## Purpose

The purpose of this chat application is to provide users with a simple way to communicate with each other in real-time. The user interface of the app was inspired by the popular messaging app Signal and has been built using Expo, React Native, and Firebase.

## Motivation

As more and more people are relying on digital communication, it's important to have a messaging platform that is both easy to use and secure. That's why I decided to build this chat application, to provide a user-friendly way for people to communicate with each other.

## Tech Stack

The chat application has been built using the following technologies:
-   Expo: An open-source platform for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React
-   React Native: A framework for building native mobile applications using React
-   Firebase: A real-time database and backend as a service provider that makes it easy to build applications that require real-time data

## Challenges

One issue that I came across while building this app was the updates to the React Native and Firebase frameworks. These updates can sometimes introduce breaking changes which can be difficult to work around. However, I have made an effort to keep the app up to date with the latest versions of these frameworks in order to ensure that it continues to function smoothly.

## Accomplishments

One accomplishment that I achieved with this chat application is the creation of a user-friendly platform for real-time communication. I have also tried to make the app as easy to use as possible, with a simple and intuitive user interface.

While I have not yet implemented the best security measures in the app, I recognize the importance of security and plan to address this in future updates. In the meantime, I have made an effort to ensure that the app follows best practices for data protection and privacy.

## Features

The Real-Time Chat Application includes the following features:

-   Account registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to the app using their email address and password.
-   Chat rooms: Users can create chat rooms and invite other users to join them.
-   Real-time chat: Users can have real-time conversations with other users who are in the same chat room as them.
-   Profile pictures: Users can update their profile pictures in the app's settings.
-   Profile pages: Users can view their own profile page as well as the profile pages of other users.

These features provide users with a simple way to communicate with each other in real-time and manage their accounts within the app.

## Future Improvements

There are a number of things that I could do to improve the chat application in the future. Some potential improvements include:

-   Adding support for additional messaging features, such as the ability to send media files or make voice and video calls
-   Improving the overall performance and scalability of the app by optimizing the database and backend infrastructure
-   Adding support for multiple languages to make the app more accessible to a wider audience
-   Implementing additional security measures to ensure that the app remains secure and private for all users.
